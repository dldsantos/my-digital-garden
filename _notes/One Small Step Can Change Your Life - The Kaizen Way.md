		  "When you improve a little each day, eventually big things occur. When you improve conditioning a little each day, eventually you have a big improvement in conditioning. Not tomorrow, not the next day, but eventually a big gain is made. Don't look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time. That's the only way it happens-and when it happens, it lasts."

	- I applaud innovation as a way to make changes ... when it works. Turning our lives around on a dime can be a source of confidence and self-respect. But I have observed that many people are crippled by the belief that innovation is the only way to change. We ignore a problem or challenge for as long as possible, and then, when we are forced by circumstances or duress, we attempt to make a large leap toward improvement. If the big leap lands us on greener territory, we congratulate ourselves, and rightly so. But if we slip and fall, the resulting pain and embarrassment can be devastating.

	- That's the problem with innovation. Too often, you meet with success in the short term, only to find yourself falling back into your old ways when your initial burst of enthusiasm fades away. Radical change is like charging up a steep hill-you may run out of wind before you reach the crest, or the thought of all the work ahead makes you give up no sooner than you've begun.

	- There is an alternative to innovation. It is another path altogether, one that winds so gently up the hill that you hardly notice the climb. It is pleasant to negotiate and soft to tread. And all it requires is that you place one foot in front of the other.

	- Instead of encouraging radical, more innovative change to produce the demanded results, the TWI course exhorted managers toward what it called "continuous improvement." The course manual urged supervisors to "look for hundreds of small things you can improve. Don't try to plan a whole new department layout-or go after a big new installation of new equipment. There isn't time for these major items. Look for improvements on existing jobs with your present equipment.

	- The Japanese were unusually receptive to this idea. Their industrial base destroyed, they lacked the resources for sweeping reorganization. And it wasn't lost on Japanese business leaders that their country had been defeated by America's superior equipment and technology-so they listened closely to the Americans' lessons on manufacturing.

	- I hope you'll want to keep in mind the original intent of the small-steps philosophy. Kaizen is an effective, enjoyable way to achieve a specific goal, but it also extends a more profound challenge: to meet life's constant demands for change by seeking out continual-but always small- improvement.”

	- Attempts to reach goals through radical or revolutionary means often fail because they heighten fear. But the small steps of kaizen disarm the brain's fear response, stimulating rational thought and creative play.

	- When you want to change but experience a block, you can often blame the midbrain for gumming up the works. The midbrain is where you'll find a structure called the amygdala (a-MIG-duh-luh). The amygdala is absolutely crucial to our survival. It controls the fightor-flight response, an alarm mechanism that we share with all other mammals.

	- The real problem with the amygdala and its fight-orflight response today is that it sets off alarm bells whenever we want to make a departure from our usual, safe routines. The brain is designed so that any new challenge or opportunity or desire triggers some degree of fear. Whether the challenge is a new job or just meeting a new person, the amygdala alerts parts of the body to prepare for action-and our access to the cortex, the thinking part of the brain, is restricted, and sometimes shut

	- In Japanese business circles, a basic tenet for using kaizen is to encourage each employee to stay vigilant on behalf of the corporation, an approach that yields profitable costcutting ideas and a highly engaged, productive workforce. However, the kaizen method works not by manic exhortation to revolutionize the company, but by requests that are much simpler and restricted in scope.

	- Questions ("What is the color of the car parked next to yours?") turn out to be more productive and useful for shaping ideas and solutions than commands ("Tell me the color of the car parked next to yours.").
	- Your brain wants to play! A question wakes up your brain and delights it. Your brain loves to take in questions, even ludicrous or odd ones, and turn them over.
	- Parents intuitively know to ask questions, then answer them, then ask again and see if the child can recall. They understand that the brain loves questions.
	- By asking small, gentle questions, we keep the fight-or-flight response in the "off" position. Kaizen questions such as "What's the smallest step I can take to be more efficient?" or "What can I do in five minutes a day to reduce my credit-card debt?" or "How could I find one source of information about adult education classes in my city?" allow us to bypass our fears.
	- Ask a question often enough, and you'll find your brain storing the questions, turning them over, and eventually generating some interesting and useful responses.
	- I believe that the mere act of posing the same question on a regular basis and waiting patiently for an answer mobilizes the cortex.
	- Their willingness to meet with them at school and ask them small questions is reflective of an ingredient basic to kaizen: respect for others, even those whose attitudes and answers we think we already understand.
	- Questioning others may also help when you have trouble pinpointing your own needs.
	- I hope you'll build the kaizen habit of asking yourself small (and positive!) questions.
	- choose a question and ask it repeatedly, over the course of several days or weeks. Instead of freezing up your brain with tall orders and angry demands, you'll experience the productive output of a brain that is pleasantly challenged.
	- The following questions are designed to form the kaizen habit of asking yourself small questions. Some of them are specifically related to goals; others give you practice in seeking out continual improvement across the categories of your life.
		- If you are trying to reach a specific goal, ask yourself every day: What is one small step I could take toward reaching my goal?

		- If you tend to feel pessimistic or negative, try asking yourself this question: What is one small thing that is special about me (or my spouse, or my organization)? If you continue to ask yourself this question over time, you'll program your brain to look for what's good and right, and you may eventually decide to capitalize on these shining aspects, perhaps with a new marketing campaign at work or ideas for family activities at home.

	- It may come as a relief to know that there's a nearly painless way to train yourself to perform difficult tasks, even those you think are unsuited to your nature and talents. This method, called mind sculpture, can help you run a tough race, go out on blind dates, or talk to employees more effectively.
	- Mind sculpture takes advantage of cutting-edge neuroscience, which suggests that the brain learns best not in large dramatic do it!-but in very small increments, smaller than ever believed possible.
	- We are often told that the best way to make a change is feet first, plunging ahead in the hopes that momentum will carry us past fear and resistance. In physical fitness, this idea takes the form of the popular exhortation "Just do it!" In dating, networking, and giving presentations, we're told, "Fake it till you make it."”
	- Mind sculpture, developed by Ian Robertson, is a newer technique that involves total but still-imaginary sensory immersion. It requires its practitioners to pretend that they are actually engaged in the action, not just seeing but hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching. In mind sculpture, people imagine the movement of their muscles, and the rise and fall of their emotions.
	- Ian Robertson, one of the world's leading authorities on brain rehabilitation, theorized in his book Mind Sculpture that during mind sculpture, the brain doesn't understand that it's not really performing the imagined activity.
	- Within minutes of "practicing" a task mentally, using all your senses, the brain's chemistry begins to change. It rewires its cells and the connections between the cells to create complex motor or verbal skills. With enough practice the new patterns are mastered.
	- In this way, you can approach a difficult task with a purely mental rehearsal, avoiding the unproductive fear that comes with the "feet-first" strategy. You can train your brain by small increments to develop the new set of skills it needs to actually engage in this task.
	- This small kaizen strategy is actually perfect for anyone who's struggled and struggled to achieve a goal that remains out of reach. That's because it's such a safe, comfortable step to take that it allows you to walk right past any mental obstacles that have held you back. Mind sculpture is so effective in neutralizing fear that it's even worked for earthquake or accident victims who suffer from flashbacks.
	- Never force the process of kaizen; it works only if you let change happen in a comfortable and easy manner.
	- Small questions are a powerful way to generate Ideas for mind sculpture.
	- Small actions take very little time or money, and they are agreeable even to those of us who haven't laid up bulk supplies of willpower. Small actions trick the brain into thinking: Hey, this change is so tiny that it's no big deal. No need to get worked up. No risk of failure or unhappiness here. By outfoxing the fear response, small actions allow the brain to build up new, permanent habits-at a pace that may be surprisingly brisk.
	- Like all the best things in life, small steps are free. And since they take only a minute or two of your time, they can fit into any schedule.
	- What makes the experience a positive or negative one is what transpires in those few minutes when you explain your problem to the people involved.
	- How can you improve the patient's experience of delays in a way that won't cost anything or demand more than a few seconds of your time?
	- For glowing health, it might be best to set your goals lower. Just a few positive changes can have a surprising Impact on your well-being. Recent research has strongly suggested that losing 10 percent of one's body weight (assuming a person is overweight to begin with) leads to radical Improvements In diabetes risk, hypertension, and sleep apnea. A study at Adeiphl University shows that people who used the treadmill just four minutes a day for four days a week (making sure to reach 70 percent of their maximum heart rate), experienced a 10 percent Increase In their aerobic capacity-the same percentage as those who exercised twenty minutes a day
	- As you plan your own small steps toward change, keep in mind that sometimes, despite your best planning, you'll hit a wall of resistance.
	- Remember that your goal is to bypass fear-and to make the steps so small that you can barely notice an effort. When the steps are easy enough, the mind will usually take over and leapfrog over obstacles to achieve your goal.
	- We are biologically "wired" to reach out for support when we're stressed; it's in our nature. But one of the most solid predictors of success in life is whether a person turns to another human for support in times of trouble or fear.
	- Then I asked Rachel to write down her feelings in a journal. Research demonstrates that people who use a journal to chart their emotions receive the same kind of psychological benefit as those who talk to a doctor or minister or friend.
	- Psychology research suggests that clients are supposed to write in their journals for at least fifteen to twenty minutes a day to receive its benefits.
	- But don't let anyone pressure you into accelerating the pace of change if it doesn't feel right to you.
	- If you ever feel yourself dreading the activity or making excuses for not performing it, it's time to cut back on the size of the step.
	- We are so accustomed to living with minor annoyances that it's not always easy to identify them, let alone make corrections. But these annoyances have a way of acquiring mass and eventually blocking your path to change. By training yourself to spot and solve small problems, you can avoid undergoing much more painful remedies later.
	- And how many times have we, in our haste to reach a goal, spotted signs of trouble-and then recategorized them as "normal," just to avoid facing them?
	- When we are trying to make a change, it can be tempting to ignore the subtle warning signs, ones that say: Something's wrong here. You need to slow down, retrace your steps, and investigate. But if we continue to avoid these small problems, they will grow and grow until we create a mess so spectacular that we are required to stop the assembly line of change, announce a recall, and proceed with the painful and time-consuming process of undoing the now-big mistake
	- **Learning to Spot Small Problems**
		- It's always easier to spot a crack in the ceiling after rain has soaked the plaster. But it's possible to train yourself to see small warning signs more clearly. Try these exercises to sharpen your small-problem vision:

			  3. Now ask yourself whether the small mistake you identified in exercise 2 reflects a larger problem, or if it has the potential to gather velocity.

			  4. Ask yourself whether there are ways in which you irritate your family, friends, co-workers, or customers. Your new awareness alone reduces the probability that you will make this mistake again, but you should also ask yourself whether this mistake is part of a bigger problem. If you can peg the error to a larger issue, you'll give yourself further incentive to work on it!
	- "Confront the difficult while it is still easy; accomplish the great task by a series of small acts." -Tao Te Ching”
	- The small steps of kaizen and the giant leaps of innovation are not mutually exclusive; used together, they become a formidable weapon against even the most profound, complex, and apparently unsolvable problems.
	- The larger the external rewards, the greater the risk of inhibiting or stunting the native drive for excellence. Big, fancy prizes remove what Dr. W. Edwards Deming, one of katzen's most passionate advocates, called "intrinsic motivation."
	- most people want to be proud of their work and want to offer useful contributions. But big cash prizes in the corporate world can send the message that an employee is a cog in the machine who must be whipped into a frenzy by the possibility of personal gain.
	- Large rewards can become the goal in and of themselves, usurping an employee's natural desire to find stimulation and creativity in the work alone. Moreover, once the large reward is in hand, a person's motivation to continue the new and desirable behavior tends to fade or disappear.
	- Southwest Airlines cannily bestows this respect by rewarding good performance with a five dollar food voucher. Their employees reward one another with written "Love Reports." If these incentives remind you of grubby candy held out to pauper children, try asking your co-workers or friends: "What makes you feel appreciated?" The resulting list is usually studded with free or low-cost items such as hearing the boss say "thank you," receiving a compliment from a superior, or having someone bring them a cup of coffee when they're working late.
	- “In private life, small rewards show gratitude while preserving the natural sense of pleasure in a job well done. If they are employed in a friendship or marriage, they can be used with a sense of humor, so that both the rewarder and the rewardee maintain equal footing.
	- "No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted." -Aesop, "The Lion and the Mouse"
	- “Small rewards have an especially useful place when incremental steps just aren't possible”
	- There are plenty of terrific ways to incorporate rewards into a kaizen plan.
		- The reward should be appropriate to the goal. For Karen Pryor, chocolate was a perfect encouragement to get to class-a small, harmless indulgence. But for the man told by his doctor to cut back on unhealthful foods, chocolate would be counterproductive.

	- The kaizen approach to life requires a slower pace and an appreciation of small moments. This pleasant technique can lead to creative breakthroughs and strengthened relationships, and give you a daily boost toward excellence
	- An American Airlines flight attendant took the time to notice that many of her passengers did not eat the olives in their salads. She thought this observation might be useful and passed this observation up the chain of command. It was eventually discovered that the airline was charged by its food supplier for salads based on the number of items they contained. The cost for a salad with one to four items was less than a salad with five to eight items. And the uneaten olives, it turned out, were the fifth item in the American Airlines salad. When the airline dropped the olives and switched to a four-item salad, it saved five hundred thousand dollars a year.
	- many great moments of progress come out of a workaday attention to the little things. I'm talking about moments that may seem ordinary or even tiresome, but actually hold the seeds of important change. Paying attention to small moments may sound easy, but it takes respect, imagination, and curiosity.
	- The president of 3M once noticed a letter from a customer asking for samples of the "mineral grit" the company used in its sandpaper. The president, William McKnight, was curious about this odd request and contacted the customer to find out more. The resulting information and collaboration led to waterproof sandpaper and other products that helped make 3M a world-class organization.
	- A Swiss engineer named George de Mestral was out walking his dog when he noticed burrs sticking to the dog's fur as well to his own clothes. De Mestral allowed the tenacious little burrs to intrigue rather than merely irritate him; his attention to this everyday moment led him to invent Velcro.
	- While on vacation with his family, inventor Edwin Land took a picture of his three-year-old daughter. She expected to see the picture right then and there. Instead of brushing off her impatience as childish and unrealistic, Land saw a possibility. Five years later, the first instant camera was invented.
	- Even if you're not interested in using kaizen to start a multimillion dollar business, small moments can help you see through a mental block. Take George, a police officer who hated his job but just couldn't think of a more suitable career.”
	- I asked him to find one moment each day when he enjoyed his police work. As he wrote down these small moments, he noticed a pattern. He felt most satisfied when he talked to prisoners in the squad car, asking them about their problems and giving them advice
	- “When you're implementing a plan for change but find yourself bored, restless, and stuck, look around for hidden moments of delight. People who are most successful at improving their health habits are those who can transform exercise or eating well into a source of excitement and pride.”
	- "The true creator may be recognized by his ability to always find about him, in the commonest and humblest thing, items worthy of note." -Igor Stravinsky
	- in the successful relationships, positive attention outweighed negative on a daily basis by a factor of five to one.
		- It took the form of small gestures, such as using a pleased tone of voice when receiving a phone call from the partner, as opposed to an exasperated tone or a rushed pace that implied the partner's call was interrupting important tasks inquiring about dentist appointments or other details of the other person's day.

	- Another application of kaizen to relationships is allowing ourselves to be interested in the small details of our partner's life.
		- Train yourself to focus on the small, positive aspects of your partner: appreciate him or her for small gestures, a pleasing tone of voice, or a kind touch
		- “try to identify one moment each day during which you can praise your partner's personality or appearance. Try "I love the way your hair looks in the morning," or "I love how excited you get on the way to the movies."
		- Acknowledging small moments reassures your partner that she is loved as a person, not just as a homemaker or breadwinner.”

		  2. If the answer Is yes, then take a step toward that change. If the answer Is no, (and often it Is) scan the room for an object or person that gives you the strongest sense of pleasure. Focus your thoughts on this Item for thirty seconds. This process trains your brain to the In the moment.
	- The beauty and the challenge of kaizen is that it requires faith. Not necessarily religious faith, or a rigid and unthinking commitment, but a belief in the power of your body and brain to carry you where you need to go. By taking small steps, you set your mental compass in a new direction, allowing your mind to do the rest.
	- Try to see kaizen as a process that is never done. Don't put it in a drawer, forgotten, once your goal has been reached. Kaizen invites us to see life as an opportunity for continuous improvement, for ever-higher standards and expanding potential.
	- We can focus on being generous in daily thoughts and actions, so that we don't hoard our kindness for some important person or event, but spend it freely when our children anger us or when an employee deserves a small compliment. We can respect ourselves by taking small steps toward improving our health and relationships; we can respect others by asking them small questions. This is not easy to do, and only you can determine the place of kaizen in your world. But as you incorporate kaizen into your routines and discover its power, you will have begun to answer a profound question: What more important task does this life hold than to draw out the possibility in each moment?
