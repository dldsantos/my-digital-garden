	- Não foi o livro mais interessante que li, e nem o mais fácil de terminar (ficou encostado na minha prateleira eletrônica por mais de 5 meses até eu decidir respirar fundo e concluir a leitura).

	- Como vários *business books* costumam fazer, este apresenta conceitos iniciais e fica *martelando* estes conceitos nos capítulos seguintes — pra fazer as coisas entrarem na cabeça da gente. Dava pro livro ser menor e mais objetivo.

	- Ainda assim, foi interessante como referência porque mostra John Doerr, que aprendeu o conceito de OKRs diretamente de Andy Grove, quando trabalhou na Intel, transmitindo esse conceito para grandes empresas — como o Google, quando estava iniciando suas atividades.

**Medir o que importa** começa com uma pergunta: o que é mais importante para os próximos 3 (ou 6, ou 12) meses? 

Empresas de sucesso se concentram nas poucas iniciativas que podem fazer uma diferença real, adiando aquelas que são menos urgentes. `(cf.115)`

#### Sobre OKRs
created-at:: 1627000332190
updated-at:: 1627000332190

A sigla **OKR** vem de **Objective** (*and*) **Key Results**. Trata-se de um sistema de gestão de resultados.

**Objective** (objetivo) é simplesmente aquilo que deve ser alcançado, nada mais, nada menos. Deve ser concreto, orientado a ações e (idealmente) inspirador. `(cf.26)`
- O objetivo é a direção. É para onde nós iremos `(cf.61)`
  
  **Key Results** (resultados-chave) medem e monitoram **como** chegar ao objetivo. Devem ser específicos, com prazos definidos, agressivos e realistas. Acima de tudo, devem ser mensuráveis e verificáveis. `(cf.26)`
- Um *Key Result* é um *milestone* `(cf.61)`
  
  Ou cumprimos os requisitos de um **KR** ou não cumprimos: não existe área cinzenta, não existe espaço pra dúvida. `(cf.27)`
  
  Não existe um caminho pre-estabelecido: os OKRs são um contrato social de cooperação para estabelecer prioridades e definir como o progresso será medido. Ainda que os **objetivos** já estejam fechados para o debate, os ***Key Results*** continuam a ser negociados. A concordância coletiva é essencial para o máximo atingimento de metas.  `(cf.86)`
  
  ```ad-tip
  title: Boas ideias para OKRs não estão ligadas à hierarquia!
  Os OKRs mais poderosos e energizantes se originam dos colaboradores da linha de frente. Rick Klau, gerente de produto do YouTube, era responsável pela *homepage* do site, a terceira mais visitada do mundo.
  
  **O problema:** apenas uma pequena parte dos usuários faziam *login* no site. Eles estavam perdendo  recursos importantes, desde salvar vídeos favoritos até se inscreverem em canais. Muito do valor do YouTube estava escondido de centenas de milhões de pessoas no mundo inteiro. 
  
  Enquanto isso, a empresa estava perdendo dados valiosos. Para resolver esse problema, a equipe de Rick propôs um OKR de seis mewww para melhorar a experiência de login no site. Eles apresentaram o seu caso ao CEO do YouTube, Salar Kamangar, que por sua vez consultou o CEO do Google, Larry Page.
  
  Larry optou por transformar o objetivo de melhorar a experiência de login em um OKR de toda a empresa, mas com uma ressalva: três meses de prazo, e não seis. `(cf.117)`
  ```
  
  **A.M.B.:** a conexão perfeita — a cola — entre os *objectives* e os *key results*, aquilo que de fato *torna o implícito explícito* é a frase  “==as measured by==”, ou **a.m.b.** (***conforme medido por***).
- Por exemplo: “Alcançaremos um certo OBJETIVO ***conforme medido pelos*** seguintes RESULTADOS CHAVE”. `(cf.94)`
### Metas
```ad-info
title: OKRs: Yin & Yang
Objetivos e Resultados Chave são o  *yin* e *yang* do estabelecimento de metas — princípio e prática, visão e execução. `(cf.122)`
```

**Metas** podem causar problemas sistemáticos nas empresas devido a estreitamento de foco, comportamento anti-ético, aumento no aceite de riscos, além de diminuição na cooperação e na motivação. `(cf.30)`
- Devemos tomar cuidado quando estabelecemos metas na empresa.
- Como todo sistema de gestão, o OKR pode ser bem executado ou mal executado — ainda assim, não nos devemos deixar enganar, pois qualquer empresa buscando alto desempenho precisa das metas para chegar lá.
  
  Enquanto reduzir o número de metas é invariavelmente um desafio, **é um desafio que vale o esforço**. Como qualquer líder experiente pode te dizer, nenhum indivíduo — e nenhuma empresa — pode "fazer tudo". Com um conjunto de OKRs selecionados, podemos destacar algumas coisas — as coisas vitais — que precisam ser feitas, conforme planejado e dentro do prazo. `(cf.116)`. Ver [[Menos é mais]]
  
  Um estudo de dois anos realizado pela Deloitte determinou que nada tem mais impacto para **provocar engajamento** dos colaboradores da empresa que "metas bem definidas que são registradas e compartilhadas livremente". As metas geram alinhamento, clareza e satisfação com o emprego. `(cf.33)`
  
  A liderança deve comunicar tanto o **porquê**  (objetivo) quanto o **o quê** (resultado chave). As pessoas precisam de mais do que *milestones* para se sentirem motivadas. Estão sedentas por significado, por entender como suas metas se relacionam com a missão. E o processo não pode parar com a revelação de OKRs vindos do topo em uma reunião trimestral geral. Como gosta de dizer Jeff Weiner, CEO do LinkedIn: `(cf.120)`
  
  ```ad-quote
  title: Fazendo as pessoas ouvirem
  “When you are tired of saying it, people are starting to hear it.”
  — Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn CEO
  ```
  
  Estabelecer as metas num modelo *bottom-up* também favorece o **engajamento**: equipes e indivíduos devem ser encorajados a estabelecer pelo menos 50% de seus próprios OKRs, em concordância com os gerentes. Quando todos os OKRs são estabelecidos *top-down* a motivação das pessoas pode se corroer.  `(cf.86)`
  
  Quando as pessoas têm prioridades conflitantes ou que não estão claras, ou metas sem sentido e que vivem mudando arbitrariamente, elas ficam frustradas, cínicas e desmotivadas. `(cf.34)` 
  
  Um sistema mais efetivo de gestão de metas — neste caso, o OKR — conecta os objetivos à missão mais ampla de uma equipe. Respeita metas e prazos enquanto se adapta às circunstâncias. Ele promove *feedback* e celebra as pequenas e grandes vitórias, expandindo os limites. Nos impele a lutar por aquilo que pareceria estar fora do nosso alcance. `(cf.34)`
  
  ```ad-note
  title: OKR não é bala de prata!
  Fiquei com o pé atrás com esse jeito de falar de OKR como *bala de prata*, ou como se fosse uma [[panacéia]]. Acredito que qualquer sistema ([[BSC]], [[Hoshin Kanri]]) pode funcionar desde que haja o desdobramento e apoio adequados e uma cultura colaborativa.
  
  Felizmente, em seu vídeo do TED, John Doerr comenta que o sistema de OKR **não é** bala de prata.
  ```

#### Os quatro superpoderes do OKR `(cf.49)`
- Focar e se comprometer com as prioridades;
- Alinhar e conectar para obter trabalho em equipe;
- Rastrear para responsabilizar (*accountability*);
- Motivar para chegar ao incrível.

  title: Sobre conhecimento
  “It almost doesn’t matter what you know. It’s what you can do with whatever you know or can acquire and actually accomplish that tends to be valued here.” (`cf.60`)
  — Andy Grove
  ```
  
  Esta citação me lembra de que [[O que você pode fazer com o que sabe é muito mais importante do que aquilo que você sabe|o que você pode fazer com o que sabe é muito mais importante do que o que você sabe]].
  
  ---
### Menos é mais

A sabedoria popular que afirma que "**menos é mais**" se aplica perfeitamente aos OKRs. Andy Grove disse que poucos objetivos bem escolhidos demonstram claramente para o que dizemos "sim" e para o que dizemos "não". 

Se eu limitar os OKRs entre 3 e 5 por período, levarei as empresas, equipes e indivíduos a escolherem aquilo que mais importa. E cada objetivo deve estar ligado a 5 ou menos KRs.  `(cf.85)`

Ver [Menos é mais](Menos%20é%20mais.md)

---
A flexibilidade importa — se o clima mudou e um objetivo nao mais aparenta ser tão pratico ou relevante quanto à época em que foi escrito, os *Key results* podem ser modificados ou descartados no meio do período. `(cf.87)`
- Isso demonstra a simplicidade e a flexibilidade do sistema de gestão por OKRs. Ele é menos engessado e regrado do que outros sistemas similares.
  
  **Ouse falhar.** Os resultados tendem a ser melhores quando todos estão lutando para alcançar uma meta com nível de realização além do seu alcance imediato.
  
  Tal estabelecimento de metas é extremamente importante se o desejado é maximizar seu próprio desempenho e o de seus subordinados. Enquanto certos objetivos operacionais devem ser completamente atingidos, os OKRs aspiracionais devem ser desconfortáveis e possivelmente inalcançáveis. `(cf.87)`
  
  ---
### OKR é uma ferramenta e não uma arma `(cf.88)`

O sistema de OKR, conforme escrito por Andy Grove; serve para ditar o ritmo de uma pessoa, dando-lhe um cronômetro em mãos para que ele meça seu próprio desempenho:

Ele não deve ser encarado como um "documento legal" em que alguém deva basear uma revisão de desempenho.

Para encorajar que as pessoas assumam riscos e evitar *[[sandbagging]]*, os OKRs e os sistemas de recompensa e bônus de uma empresa andam melhor separados.

---

```ad-quote
title: Seja paciente. Seja decidido.
**"Be patient; be resolute. Every process requires trial and error."**
— Andy Grove
```

Não se pode esperar que as empresas e seus colaboradores entendam logo de cara a lógica e o funcionamento completo do sistema de gestão por OKRs. Mas a percepção melhora com o tempo, e podem ser necessários 4 ou 5 trimestres de execução para que todos *abracem* os OKRs e ainda mais tempo para tornar o sistema maduro. `(cf.89)`

### Viagem ao centro da Europa
Uma amostra de como estar com as metas alinhadas entre todos da equipe, desde o mais alto nível até os níveis mais baixos, ***pode fazer você chegar no destino correto***:

```ad-quote
title:
If you tell everybody to go to the center of Europe, and some start marching off to France, and some to Germany, and some to Italy, that’s no good—not if you want them all going to Switzerland. If the vectors point in different directions, they add up to zero. But if you get everybody pointing in the same direction, you maximize the results.

### Operação Crush

**Contexto:**
- Em 1971, o engenheiro Ted Hoff, da Intel, inventou o microprocessador original, o *computador em um chip*, que podia ser usado para múltiplas aplicações.
- Em 1975, Bill Gates e Paul Allen programaram o processador Intel 8080, de terceira geração, lançando a revolução que seriam os computadores pessoais.
- Ao final de 1978, a Intel havia desenvolvido o primeiro processador de 16 bits de alta performance, o 8086, que encontrou um mercado pronto pra ele.
- Mas a Intel começou a ser repetidamente atacada em sua posição de liderança por dois chips mais rápidos e mais fáceis de programar: o Motorola 68000 e o estreante Z8000, da Zilog.
- Esta situação provocou uma reação da força de vendas da Intel, preocupada  com a concorrência. Depois que a reação chegou a Andy Grove, então COO da Intel, ele falou com os executivos e a Intel criou seu plano para uma contraofensiva.
- Todos consideraram que o grande inimigo naquele instante era a Motorola e seu chip 68000, dado que ela já era uma empresa gigante, "*um Golias*" `(cf.91)`, e que a Zilog não era uma ameaça séria.
- "*We have to crush the f—king bastards. We’re gonna roll over Motorola and make sure they don’t come back again.*" `(cf.92)`
- E assim nasceu a **Operação Crush**, a campanha da Intel para restaurar a empresa ao seu lugar de direito como líder do mercado de microprocessadores.
  
  **A Operação**
- Em janeiro de 1980, munidos de vídeos gravados pelo próprio Andy Grove para "*inspirar as tropas*" `(cf.93)`, equipes da operação Crush foram enviadas aos escritórios de vendas da Intel no mundo todo.
- Ao final do segundo trimestre, as equipes de vendas já haviam lançado a nova estratégia completamente.
- Ao final do terceiro trimestre as equipes de vendas estavam próximas de alcançar um objetivo ousado: fechar 2000 *design wins*, que são acordos para que os fabricantes embarquem o processador 8086 em seus dispositivos.
- No final de 1980, a Intel desbancou a Motorola e venceu sua batalha.
  
  **Bastidores e OKRs**
- Nenhum produto da Intel foi modificado para a operação Crush. `(cf.93)`
- Grove e sua equipe alteraram os termos de **engajamento**. Mudaram seu marketing para enfatizar as forças da empresa: levaram seus clientes a perceber o valor de sistemas e serviços a longo prazo em contra-partida à facilidade de uso de curto prazo.
- Ou seja, pararam de vender para **programadores** e passaram a vender para **CEOs**.
- A operação Crush foi completamente cascateada por OKRs `(cf.110)`, solicitada a partir da alta administração, mas com *inputs* vindos dos níveis inferiores da Intel. Não dava pra saber toda a mecânica de como a batalha deveria ser ganha (*dá pra dizer para alguém limpar uma bagunça, mas você deve dizer que vassoura usar?*).

  ---
  > The more ambitious the OKR, the greater the risk of overlooking a vital criterion. To safeguard quality while pushing for quantitative deliverables, one solution is to pair key results—to measure “both effect and counter-effect,”

  ---
  > A few goal-setting ground rules: Key results should be succinct, specific, and measurable. A mix of outputs and inputs is helpful. Finally, completion of all key results must result in attainment of the objective. If not, it’s not an OKR.

  > Less Is More
  > As Steve Jobs understood, “Innovation means saying no to one thousand things.” In most cases, the ideal number of quarterly OKRs will range between three and five. It may be tempting to usher more objectives inside the velvet rope, but it’s generally a mistake. Too many objectives can blur our focus on what counts, or distract us into chasing the next shiny thing. 
  
  ---
  > Once contributors have consulted with their managers and committed to their OKRs for the quarter, any add-on objectives or key results must fit into the established agenda. How does the new goal stack up against my existing ones? Should something be dropped to make room for the new commitment? In a high-functioning OKR system, top-down mandates to “just do more” are obsolete. Orders give way to questions, and to one question in particular: What matters most?
  
  ---
  > The one thing an [OKR] system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. . . . Each time you make a commitment, you forfeit your chance to commit to something else. This, of course, is an inevitable, inescapable consequence of allocating any finite resource. People who plan have to have the guts, honesty, and discipline to drop projects as well as to initiate them, to shake their heads “no” as well as to smile “yes.” . . . We must realize—and act on the realization—that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing
  
  ---
  > “ The art of management,” Grove wrote, “lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them.”
  
  ---
  > Or as Larry Page would say, winning organizations need to “put more wood behind fewer arrows.”
  
  ---
  > We don’t hire smart people to tell them what to do.
  > We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.
  > —Steve Jobs
  
  ---
  > With the eruption of social media, transparency is the default setting for our daily lives. It’s the express lane to operating excellence. Yet at most companies today, goals remain secrets. Too many CEOs share the frustration of Aaron Levie, founder and CEO of Box, the enterprise cloud company. “At any given time,” Aaron said, “some significant percentage of people are working on the wrong things. The challenge is knowing which ones.”
  
  ---
  > In a recent survey of one thousand working U.S. adults, 92 percent said they’d be more motivated to reach their goals if colleagues could see their progress.
  
  ---
  > Meritocracy flourishes in sunlight. When people write down “This is what I’m working on,” it’s easier to see where the best ideas are coming from. Soon it’s apparent that the individuals moving up are the ones doing what the company most values. Organizational poisons—suspicion, sandbagging, politicking—lose their toxic power.
  
  ---
  > Transparency seeds collaboration. Say Employee A is struggling to reach a quarterly objective. Because she has publicly tracked her progress, colleagues can see she needs help. They jump in, posting comments and offering support. The work improves. Equally important, work relationships are deepened, even transformed.
  
  ---
  > Unfortunately, alignment is rare. Studies suggest that only 7 percent of employees “fully understand their company’s business strategies and what’s expected of them in order to help achieve the common goals.”
  
  ---
  > Everything seems important; everything seems urgent. But what really needs to get done?”
  > The answer lies in focused, transparent OKRs. They knit each individual’s work to team efforts, departmental projects, and the overall mission. As a species, we crave connection. In the workplace, we’re naturally curious about what our leaders are doing and how our work weaves into theirs. OKRs are the vehicle of choice for vertical alignment.
  
  ---
  > Now, what’s wrong with this picture? Here’s a clue: The SVP’s key results are a mess. Unlike the head coach’s KRs, they’re unmeasurable. They’re not specific or time bound. How do we define “improvement,” for example, in the team’s media coverage? (Five special features on ESPN? One cover spread in Sports Illustrated ? Fifty percent more followers on social media?)
  > But even if the SVP came up with stronger key results, the organization’s goal-setting approach would remain deeply flawed. The top-line objective—to make a wealthy person wealthier—lacks intrinsic motivation for the general manager, much less for the team’s East Coast scout or the PR intern slaving away at the copy machine.
  
  ---
  > Fortunately, we have an alternative. Precisely because OKRs are transparent, they can be shared without cascading them in lockstep. If it serves the larger purpose, multiple levels of hierarchy can be skipped over. Rather than laddering down from the CEO to a VP to a director to a manager (and then to the manager’s reports), an objective might jump from the CEO straight to a manager, or from a director to an individual contributor. Or the company’s leadership might present its OKRs to everyone at once and trust people to say, “Okay, now I see where we’re going, and I’ll adapt my goals to that.”
  
  ---
  > Having goals improves performance. Spending hours cascading goals up and down the company, however, does not. . . . We have a market-based approach, where over time our goals all converge because the top OKRs are known and everyone else’s OKRs are visible. Teams that are grossly out of alignment stand out, and the few major initiatives that touch everyone are easy enough to manage directly.
  
  ---
  > The antithesis of cascading might be Google’s “20 percent time,” which frees engineers to work on side projects for the equivalent of one day per week. By liberating some of the sharpest minds in captivity, Google has changed the world as we know it. In 2001, the young Paul Buchheit initiated a 20 percent project with the code name Caribou . It’s now known as Gmail, the world’s leading web-based email service.
  
  ---
  > Innovation tends to dwell less at the center of an organization than at its edges. The most powerful OKRs typically stem from insights outside the C-suite.
  
  ---
  > An optimal OKR system frees contributors to set at least some of their own objectives and most or all of their key results. People are led to stretch above and beyond, to set more ambitious targets and achieve more of those they set: “ The higher the goals, the higher the performance.” People who choose their destination will own a deeper awareness of what it takes to get there.
  
  ---
  > When our how is defined by others, the goal won’t engage us to the same degree. If my doctor orders me to lower my blood pressure by training for the San Francisco Marathon, I might grudgingly take it under advisement. But if I decide of my own free will to run the race, I’m far more likely to reach the finish line—especially if I’m running with friends.
  
  ---
  > When leaders are attuned to the fluctuating needs of both the business and their employees, the mix of top-down and bottom-up goals generally settles at around half-and-half. Which sounds about right to me.
  
  ---
  > For innovation and advanced problem solving, isolated individuals cannot match a connected group. Product relies on engineering, marketing on sales. As business becomes more intricate and initiatives more complex, interdependent divisions need a tool to help them reach the finish line together.
  
  ---
  > When goals are public and visible to all, a “team of teams” can attack trouble spots wherever they surface. Adds Bock: “You can see immediately if somebody’s hitting the ball out of the park—you investigate. If somebody’s missing all the time, you investigate. Transparency creates very clear signals for everyone. You kick off virtuous cycles that reinforce your ability to actually get your work done. 
  
  ---
  > OKRs are not islands. To the contrary, they create networks—vertical, horizontal, diagonal—to connect an organization’s most vital work. When employees align with a company’s top-line goals, their impact is amplified. They stop duplicating efforts or working counterproductively against the grain.
  
  ---
  > strong alignment is critical to the day-to-day progress that kindles the next big leap.
  
  ---
  > When you come down to it, alignment is about helping people understand what you want them to do. Most contributors will be motivated to ladder up to the top-line OKRs—assuming they know where to set the ladder.
  
  ---
  > It took eighteen months to straighten out our division’s alignment, and we couldn’t have done it without OKRs. First, we had to define our capacity constraints for developing new software. Then we had to clarify our core priorities. By sharing our high-level OKRs for Connected Fitness, I could explain why certain projects required the allocated time, and where we should be doubling down on the company’s top goals. “This is the process we use,” I said, “and I’m showing you our objectives and key results. You need to let me know if you see anything missing, or if you think we’re working on the wrong things.”
  
  ---
  > Focus and alignment are binary stars. In May 2015, three months after Under Armour acquired us, our Premium subscription version finally launched. It couldn’t happen until we openly admitted, “Look, we can’t get all of these things done. We have to choose.” We had to make it clear to the company that Premium was our number-one objective, above all else.
  
  ---
  > We publish our objectives on a wiki that anybody in the company can see. We discuss them at weekly all-hands meetings.
  
  ---
  > With OKRs entrenched as the operational foundation for Connected Fitness, my hope is to spread them by example throughout Under Armour. The larger the organization, the more value the system offers.
  
  ---
  > OBJECTIVE
  > Help more people around the world.
  > KEY RESULTS
  > 1. Add 27M new users in 2014.
  > 2. Reach 80M total registered users.
  
  ---
  > When we face a trade-off between our customers and a business goal, we align with the customer.
  
  ---
  > People can’t connect with what they cannot see; networks cannot blossom in silos. By definition, OKRs are open and visible to all parts of an organization, to each level of every department. As a result, companies that stick with them become more coherent
  
  ---
  > A few years ago, to help the IT department adapt as Intuit moved to the cloud, Atticus introduced OKRs to his direct reports. The following quarter, he rolled the system down to the director level; the quarter after that, to all six hundred IT employees
  
  ---
  > “We didn’t want bureaucratic compliance,” Atticus says. “We wanted enthusiastic compliance. I wanted to see if the OKR system would succeed on its own—and it really did.”
  
  ---
  > In the storm of any disruption, IT will bear the brunt of in-house frustrations. Partly it’s because the operation tends to be opaque
  
  ---
  > In IT, we’re always juggling the needs of internal partners with the demands of our end users. We bridge technology and business outcomes. Maybe toughest of all, we must balance the task of making systems work perfectly today (as our people expect) with our mandate to invest in the future.
  
  ---
  > At Intuit, change started at the top. To jump-start our transformation, our chairman and CEO, Brad Smith, installed a company-wide goal-setting system. Brad is very conscious and intentional about this. Once each month, managers meet with their reports to discuss individual goals. The system has built-in, 360-degree feedback, with both parties comparing notes on a regular basis
  
  ---
  > Modern IT goes way beyond checking off boxes to process help tickets or change requests. It’s about adding value to the business—shedding redundant clone systems, creating new functionality, finding future-oriented solutions
  
  ---
  > One of our top-level EBS objectives is to “rationalize, modernize, and secure all technology used to run Intuit.”
  
  ---
  > There’s an art to goal setting, and more than a few judgment calls. If you choose to temporarily elevate a key result, it helps to be candid about it. Leaders need to explain, “Yes, I want us to focus on that one right now as a top-level objective. When it no longer needs the extra attention, we’ll let it drift back down into a KR.” It’s a dynamic system. You’re always adjusting the altitude.

  > In God we trust; all others must bring data.

  ---
  > Without frequent status updates, goals slide into irrelevance; the gap between plan and reality widens by the day. At quarter’s end (or worse, year’s end), we’re left with zombie OKRs, on-paper what s and how s devoid of life or meaning.
  
  ---
  > As the bar for structured goal setting rises, more organizations are adopting robust, dedicated, cloud-based OKR management software

  > With three or four clicks, users can navigate a digital dashboard to create, track, edit, and score their OKRs. These platforms deliver transformative OKR values:
  
  ---
  > They make everyone’s goals more visible

  > They promote internal networking

  > For an OKR system to function effectively, the team deploying it—whether a group of top executives or an entire organization—must adopt it universally. No exceptions, no opt-outs. Yes, there will be late adopters, resisters, and garden-variety procrastinators. To prod them to join the flock, a best practice is to designate one or more OKR shepherds
  
  ---
  > We have so many great opportunities before us (search, ads, display, YouTube, Android, enterprise, local, commerce, Chrome, TV, mobile, social . . .) that if you can’t come up with OKRs that get you excited about coming to work every day, then something must be wrong. In fact, if that’s really the case, come see me.

  > Research suggests that making measured headway can be more incentivizing than public recognition, monetary inducements, or even achieving the goal itself. Daniel Pink, the author of Drive , agrees: “ The single greatest motivator is ‘making progress in one’s work.’ The days that people make progress are the days they feel most motivated and engaged.”

  > we have four options at any point in the cycle:
  
  ---
  > Continue : If a green zone (“on track”) goal isn’t broken, don’t fix it
  
  ---
  > Update : Modify a yellow zone (“needs attention”) key result or objective to respond to changes in the workflow or external environment. What could be done differently to get the goal on track? Does it need a revised time line? Do we back-burner other initiatives to free up resources for this one?
  
  ---
  > Start : Launch a new OKR mid-cycle, whenever the need arises
  
  ---
  > Stop : When a red zone (“at risk”) goal has outlived its usefulness, the best solution may be to drop it.
  
  ---
  > The point of a real-time dashboard is to quantify progress against a target and flag what needs attention. While OKRs are primarily a positive force for more , they also stop us from persisting in the wrong direction
  
  ---
  > As Stephen Covey noted, “ If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just gets us to the wrong place faster.”
  
  ---
  > Whenever a key result or objective becomes obsolete or impractical, feel free to end it midstream. There’s no need to hold stubbornly to an outdated projection—strike it from your list and move on. Our goals are servants to our purpose, not the other way around.
  
  ---
  > One proviso: When an objective gets dropped before the end of the OKR interval, it’s important to notify everyone depending on it. Then comes reflection: What did I learn that I didn’t foresee at the beginning of the quarter? And: How will I apply this lesson in the future?
  
  Uma interseção interessante neste ponto, em que o conceito de OKR e de HANSEI se unificam: dado que a natureza do OKR não é necessariamente perene ou escrita em pedra, é possível refletir e melhorar para os próximos OKRs.

  > Whenever a committed OKR is failing, a rescue plan is devised. At Google, the frequency of team check-ins varies with the business needs of the moment, the gap between predicted outcomes and execution, the quality of intragroup communication, and the group’s size and location(s).

  ---
  > OKRs do not expire with completion of the work. As in any data-driven system, tremendous value can be gained from post hoc evaluation and analysis. In both one-on-ones and team meetings, these wrap-ups consist of three parts: objective scoring, subjective self-assessment, and reflection.
  
  ---
  > Scoring
  > In scoring our OKRs, we mark what we’ve achieved and address how we might do it differently next time. A low score forces reassessment: Is the objective still worth pursuing? If so, what can we change to achieve it?
  
  ---
  > The simplest, cleanest way to score an objective is by averaging the percentage completion rates of its associated key results. Google uses a scale of 0 to 1.0:
  > • 0.7 to 1.0 = green. * (We delivered.)
  > • 0.4 to 0.6 = yellow. (We made progress, but fell short of completion.)
  > • 0.0 to 0.3 = red. (We failed to make real progress.)
  
  ---
  > As a rule, we’d enter a quarter knowing we wouldn’t achieve all of them. If a department so much as approached 100 percent, it was presumed to be setting its sights too low—and there would be hell to pay.
  
  ---
  > Where OKR scores pinpoint what went right or wrong in the work, and how the team might improve, self-assessments drive a superior goal-setting process for the next quarter. There are no judgments, only learnings.
  
  ---
  > The philosopher and educator John Dewey went a step further: “ We do not learn from experience . . . we learn from reflecting on experience.”
  
  ---
  > Here are some reflections for closing out an OKR cycle:
  > • Did I accomplish all of my objectives? If so, what contributed to my success?
  > • If not, what obstacles did I encounter?
  > • If I were to rewrite a goal achieved in full, what would I change?
  > • What have I learned that might alter my approach to the next cycle’s OKRs?

  > Even before Paul Allen and I started the partnership, we were saying: A computer on every desk and in every home . IBM and other people—with resources and skill sets way beyond ours—weren’t aiming for that goal. They didn’t see it as a possibility, so they weren’t pushing as hard to make it a reality. But we could see that it would happen. Moore’s law would make things cheaper and get the software industry to critical mass. Those were big, big goals, and they started early for us.
  
  ---
  > I’m a huge fan of goals, but they need to be handled correctly. At one point, the malaria team thought we’d eradicate the disease by 2015, which wasn’t realistic. When a goal is too aspirational, it’s bad for credibility. In philanthropy, I see people confusing objectives with missions all the time. A mission is directional. An objective has a set of concrete steps that you’re intentionally engaged in and actually trying to go for. It’s fine to have an ambitious objective, but how do you scale it? How do you measure it?
  
  ---
  > Until you set a really big goal, like vaccinating every child everywhere, you can’t find out which lever or mix of levers is most important. Our annual strategy reviews began with: “What is the objective here? Is it eradication or is it expanding the reach of vaccines?” Then we could get more practical with our key results—like the 80/90 rule at the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, where 80 percent of districts would have 90 percent or more coverage. You need those key results to align your everyday activities, and over time you keep moving them to be even more ambitious against that really big goal.

A BHAG serves as a unifying focal point of effort, galvanizing people and creating team spirit as people strive toward a finish line. Like the 1960s NASA moon mission, a BHAG captures the imagination and grabs people in the gut.

Craig Venter—to choose fourteen “Grand Engineering Challenges” for the twenty-first century. After a year of debate, the panel settled on an array of quintessential stretch goals: Generate energy from fusion. Reverse-engineer the brain. Prevent nuclear terror. Secure cyberspace. (You get the picture.)

  > Two OKR Baskets
  > Google divides its OKRs into two categories, committed goals and aspirational (or “stretch”) goals. It’s a distinction with a real difference.
  > Committed objectives are tied to Google’s metrics: product releases, bookings, hiring, customers. Management sets them at the company level, employees at the departmental level. In general, these committed objectives—such as sales and revenue goals—are to be achieved in full (100 percent) within a set time frame.
  > Aspirational objectives reflect bigger-picture, higher-risk, more future-tilting ideas. They originate from any tier and aim to mobilize the entire organization. By definition, they are challenging to achieve. Failures—at an average rate of 40 percent—are part of Google’s territory.
  > The relative weighting of these two baskets is a cultural question. It will vary from one organization to the next, and from quarter to quarter. Leaders must ask themselves: What type of company do we need to be in the coming year? Agile and daring, to crack a new market—or more conservative and operational, to firm up our existing position? Are we in survival mode, or is there cash on hand to bet big for a big reward? What does our business require, right now?

  > Andy Grove was a fan of Abraham Maslow, the mid-twentieth-century psychologist best known for his “hierarchy of needs.” According to Maslow, only after we satisfy more basic concerns—starting with food and shelter, then safety, then “love” and “belongingness”—can we move to higher-level motivations. At the top of Maslow’s pyramid stands the need for “self-actualization”:

  > Consider Gmail. The main problem with earlier web-based email systems was meager storage, typically 2 to 4 megabytes. Users were forced to delete old emails to make room for new ones. Archives were a pipe dream. During Gmail’s development, Google’s leaders considered offering 100MB of storage—an enormous upgrade. But by 2004, when the product was released to the public, the 100MB goal was dead and forgotten. Instead, Gmail provided a full gigabyte of storage, up to five hundred times more than the competition. Users could keep emails in perpetuity. Digital communication changed forever.
  > That , my friends, is a Big Hairy Audacious Goal. Gmail didn’t merely improve on existing systems. It reinvented the category and forced competitors to raise their game by orders of magnitude. Such 10x thinking is rare in any sector, on any stage. Most people, Larry Page observes, “ tend to assume that things are impossible, rather than starting from real-world physics and figuring out what’s actually possible.”
  
  ---
  > Thousand percent improvement requires rethinking problems, exploring what’s technically possible and having fun in the process
  
  ---
  > Google has had its share of colossal misfires, from Helpouts to Google Answers. Living in the 70 percent zone entails a liberal sprinkling of moonshots and a willingness to court failure. At the start of the period, not a single goal may look possible. And so the Googlers are pushed to ask harder questions: What radical, high-risk action needs to be considered? What do they need to stop doing? Where can they move resources or find new partners? By deadline, a healthy fraction of those impossible goals are somehow attained in full.
  
  ---
  > But as Larry Page says, “ If you set a crazy, ambitious goal and miss it, you’ll still achieve something remarkable.” When you aim for the stars, you may come up short but still reach the moon.
  
  ---
  > In Google’s OKR climate, it was understood that 70 percent achievement (on average) was considered a success. You weren’t supposed to strive for greens on every OKR you wrote—that wouldn’t stretch the team. But there was an intrinsic tension because you didn’t get hired at Google unless you were driven to succeed. As a leader, you didn’t want to find yourself at the end of the quarter, standing in front of the company with a big red on the screen, having to explain why and how you failed. The pressure and discomfort of that experience made a lot of us do a lot of heroic things to avoid it. But if you set your team’s objectives correctly, it was sometimes unavoidable

  > The Next Frontier
  > My father came of age in a time when computing meant huge teams and mainframes and system administrators—when computers were both inaccessible and very complicated. By the time I was working on Chrome, I realized that all he wanted was an easy, straightforward way to use the web. I’ve always been fascinated by simplicity. For all the complex things Google Search could do, the user experience was phenomenally uncomplicated. I wanted to emulate that quality in our browser—to the point where you could be a kid in India or a professor at Stanford, and it wouldn’t matter. If you had access to a computer and adequate connectivity, your experience with Chrome would be manifestly simple. * 
  
  ---
  > In 2008, when my father was retired, I gave him a netbook and showed him how to use Chrome. And then an amazing thing happened for him: The technology just faded away. He could just do whatever he wanted on the thriving applications platform on the web. Once he got into our browser, he never opened another app. He never downloaded another piece of software. He lived in Chrome. He surrendered into a new and wonderfully simple world

  > Then Salar Kamangar turned over day-to-day leadership for the tech side of YouTube to Shishir Mehrotra, and Shishir helped bring focus to the whole company. He used a metaphor called the Big Rocks Theory, which was popularized by Stephen Covey. Say you have some rocks, and a bunch of pebbles, and some sand, and your goal is to fit as much of everything as you can into a wide-mouth, one-gallon jar. If you start with the sand, and then the pebbles, the jar will run out of room for all the rocks. But when you start with the rocks, add the pebbles, and save the sand for last, the sand fills the spaces between the rocks—everything fits. In other words, the most important things need to get done first or they won’t get done at all.
  
  ---
  > But what were YouTube’s big rocks? People did their own things and let a thousand flowers bloom, but no one could identify the top-level OKRs. Now leadership was saying, “All of your ideas are wonderful. But could we please identify a few of them as our big rocks for this quarter, and for the year?” After that, everyone at YouTube knew our top priorities. All of our big rocks would make it into the jar.
  > That was a giant step toward the goal that swallowed the next four years of my life.
  
  ---
  > As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has pointed out: In a world where computing power is nearly limitless, “ the true scarce commodity is increasingly human attention.” When users spend more of their valuable time watching YouTube videos, they must perforce be happier with those videos. It’s a virtuous circle: More satisfied viewership (watch time) begets more advertising, which incentivizes more content creators, which draws more viewership
  
  ---
  > Our true currency wasn’t views or clicks—it was watch time. The logic was undeniable. YouTube needed a new core metric.
  
  ---
  > While one billion daily hours sounded like an awful lot, it represented less than 20 percent of the world’s total television watch time. Introducing that context was helpful and clarifying, at least for me. We weren’t gunning to be arbitrarily big. Rather: There was another thing out there way bigger than us, and we were trying to scale up to it.

Even Peter Drucker, the champion of well-measured goals, understood the limits of calibration. A manager’s “first role,” Drucker said, “is the personal one. It’s the relationship with people, the development of mutual confidence . . . the creation of a community.” Or as Albert Einstein observed, “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.”
  
  ---
  > That transformational system, the contemporary alternative to annual reviews, is continuous performance management . It is implemented with an instrument called CFRs, for:
  > • Conversations : an authentic, richly textured exchange between manager and contributor, aimed at driving performance
  > • Feedback : bidirectional or networked communication among peers to evaluate progress and guide future improvement
  > • Recognition : expressions of appreciation to deserving individuals for contributions of all sizes
  
  ---
  > You need continuous performance management to surface the critical questions: Was the goal harder to achieve than you’d thought when you set it? Was it the right goal in the first place? Is it motivating? Should we double down on the two or three things that really worked for us last quarter, or is it time to consider a pivot? You need to elicit those insights from all over the organization.

  > Under our new system, our contributors get highly specific performance feedback at least once every six weeks. But in practice it happens every week. Everybody knows where they stand and how they’re contributing value to the company. Instead of lagging, the performance management process is leading.

  > Corrective feedback is naturally difficult for people. But when done well, it’s also the greatest gift you can give to someone—because it can change people’s mindset and modify their behavior in the most positive, valuable way.

  > OKRs are a superb training tool for executives and managers. They teach you how to manage your business within existing limits. It’s important to push the envelope, but the envelope is real. Everybody faces resource constraints: time, money, people. And the bigger an organization, the more entropy—it’s like thermodynamics

The agenda is you, the individual, and what you are trying to accomplish personally over the next two to three years, and how you’re breaking that into a two-week plan. I like to start with three questions: What makes you very happy? What saps your energy? How would you describe your dream job?

  > Andy Grove understood the paramount importance of this interplay. “Put simply,” he wrote in High Output Management , culture is “a set of values and beliefs, as well as familiarity with the way things are done and should be done in a company.

  > 3. Meaning of work: Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
  > 4. Dependability: Can we count on each other to do high-quality work on time?
  > 5. Impact of work: Do we fundamentally believe that the work we’re doing matters?
  > The first item on this list—structure and clarity—is the raison d’être for objectives and key results. The others are all key facets of a healthy workplace culture, and tie directly to OKR superpowers and CFR communication tools.
  
  ---
  > An OKR culture is an accountable culture. You don’t push toward a goal just because the boss gave you an order. You do it because every OKR is transparently important to the company, and to the colleagues who count on you. Nobody wants to be seen as the one holding back the team. Everybody takes pride in moving progress forward. It’s a social contract, but a self-governed one.
  
  ---
  > In the high-stakes arena of culture change, OKRs lend us purpose and clarity as we plunge into the new. CFRs supply the energy we need for the journey. Where people have authentic conversations and get constructive feedback and recognition for superior accomplishment, enthusiasm becomes infectious. The same goes for stretch thinking and a commitment to daily improvement. The companies that treat their people as valued partners are the ones with the best customer service. They have the best products and strongest sales growth. They’re the ones who are going to win.

His “trust index” measures specific behaviors—the direct “hows” of transparency, for example. “I avoid asking people about their perceptions,” Dov told me. “I don’t ask, ‘Do you feel your company is honest with you?’ I look at information flows. Does the company hoard information, does it mete it out on a need-to-know basis, or is it flowing freely? If you go around your boss and talk to somebody more senior, are you punished or celebrated?”

  “Window dressing” é uma expressão idiomática que significa “deixar mais bonito ou atraente do que realmente é”. Usado no contexto de OKRs

Edge was already an accomplished guitar player and Larry was a pretty good drummer, but I was a poor singer and Adam really couldn’t play the bass at all. But here’s what we thought: We’re not as good as those other groups. So we better be better .
  
  ---
  > How did we measure effectiveness? Well, at the outset, we asked questions about our place in the world, beyond the pop charts or the clubs. Like: Can our music be useful ? Can art inspire political change? In 1979, when we were just eighteen, one of our first jobs was an anti-apartheid show. Another was a pro-contraception show—in Ireland, that was a big deal. Later, in our early twenties, we deliberately became a nuisance to what you might call Irish terror groups and all the people who felt ambivalent about them. We felt compelled to say that blowing up kids in supermarkets can never be right. We gauged our political impact by the torrent of bile that came back at us.
  
  Eu nunca imaginaria pensar em indicadores para medir o sucesso de um grupo musical. Mas eis que, nas palavras do vocalista do U2, Bono, é exatamente nisso que a banda se concentrava — e desde que tinham cerca de 18 anos!

  > And then at some point, you want your songs to chart. We worked quite hard to break through to the mainstream, actually. We were a live phenomenon, but our singles didn’t do very well. So we judged our success by selling tickets, and then by selling albums
  
  Neste outro comentário do Bono, é possível notar que a banda tinha uma visão: querer emplacar seus singles na lista das músicas mais tocadas. Inicialmente eles não conseguiram — mas como eram muito bons nas aparições e apresentações ao vivo, mediam seu sucesso através do número  de ingressos vendidos para seus shows e do número de discos vendidos para o público.

  > When we formed our nonprofit DATA, we went about it exactly the same as I had with U2. It was a band: Lucy Matthew, Bobby Shriver, Jamie Drummond, and myself. We didn’t know who was the singer or the bass player or the drummer or the guitar player. But we knew we weren’t a bunch of hippies and wishful thinkers. We were more punk rock. We were tough-minded opportunists. We were working on a single idea: debt cancellation for the poorest countries. We were good at that, choosing one fight at a time and going at it with a vicious schedule
  
  Quando criou a DATA, Bono contou com investimentos vindos da fundação Bill and Melinda Gates, e tratou sua ONG da mesma forma que sabia fazer em outro terreno onde alcançou sucesso: assim a DATA era, desde o princípio, como se fosse uma banda musical.

  > Then we went after universal access to anti-AIDS drugs, another clear goal, and I must say, people did laugh in our face: “You are out of your tiny mind. That’s impossible. Why fight the most expensive disease when you could have a go at malaria or river blindness? Or finish off polio?”
  > And I remember saying, “No, we’re picking a fight with this disease because these two pills”—it’s one pill now—“are a visual representation of inequality. If you live in Dublin or Palo Alto, you can get the pills. If you live in Lilongwe, Malawi, in Africa, you can’t get the pills. So because of an accident of longitude and latitude, you live or you die. That doesn’t feel right.”
  
  Bono explica porque resolveu lutar para que o acesso a medicação para tratar a AIDS fosse universal. Chamado de louco por muitos e ouvindo que era impossível porque a luta conta a AIDS seria cara demais quando comparada à luta contra outras doenças, como a malária, ele não desistiu de lutar para alcançar seu objetivo porque nunca achou correto que um “acidente de latitude e longitude” fosse um motivo justo para que a população africana fosse privada de poder usar a medicação (“porque alguém em Dubai ou Palo Alto tem acesso à medicação e alguém na África não?”).

  > That was years before we used OKRs, but even then I used to say, “Picture Everest, then describe how difficult the climb is. Then describe how we’re going to reach the summit.” Like Everest, beating AIDS looked nearly impossible. First you needed to be able to describe it. Then you could climb it.
  
  Eis uma metáfora interessante citada pelo Bono com relação à vencer desafios. Ele comparou tornar o uso de medicação contra AIDS universal à escalar o Monte Everest: “imagine escalar o Everest e descreva como a escalada seria difícil. Depois descreva como vai alcançar o topo da montanha. Sabendo descrever como vai fazer isso, você será capaz de escalar o Everest”.

  > So now it’s 2017, and 21 million people are accessing the antiretroviral therapies. It’s amazing. And AIDS-related deaths are down 45 percent in the last ten years. New HIV infections in children are down by more than half. And we’re on pace to win the fight against mother-to-child transmission by 2020, to finish the disease off. I believe we will live to see an AIDS-free world in our lifetime
  
  Aqui destaco alguns resultados do DATA, a ONG de Bono, na sua empreitada para promover a erradicação da AIDS no mundo. Traçando metas eles parecem ter obtido sucesso. Imagino se eles conseguiram reduzir a transmissão da doença de mãe para filho quando chegamos em 2020 (o livro de onde tirei isso é de 2017).

  > Our NGO band was entrepreneurial in spirit, and we tracked our goals internally. But you can only go so far without process. Once we started to have real impact and real access, DATA merited more data—more measurable procedures, more measurable outcomes.
  
  Um grupo com espírito empreendedor como o DATA foi capaz de acompanhar suas metas internamente, mas reconheceu que assim que começaram a “encorpar” e ter impacto real, precisavam de processos e procedimentos mais estruturados, para coletar ainda mais dados, medir o resultado dos processos e os resultados da própria ONG.

  > We had so many brilliant, gifted people, but our problem was way too many goals. A green revolution in Africa. Girls’ education. Energy poverty. Global warming. We were all over the map.
  
  A DATA tinha metas demais. Isso me faz pensar na frase que alguns colegas de melhoria contínua me ensinaram: “quem quer abraçar muito, aperta pouco”. Acho a frase perfeita para esse ponto.
  
  ---
  > DATA and ONE merged two very different cultures—it was tricky. We realized we were ourselves lacking in transparency. If you don’t have clear sign-offs to your goals, you get overlap and dissonance. People get confused about their jobs. For a time we had a real schism in our organization.

  > “Bono, do you know the Senegalese proverb ‘If you want to cut a man’s hair, it is better if he is in the room’?” He said it in a loving way, but we didn’t miss the message: Be careful if you think you know what we want. Because we know what we want. You’re not African, and this messiah complex hasn’t always turned out so well.
  
  Excelente provérbio senegalês. Me faz pensar no seguinte: ao levar em conta o que alguém deseja (por exemplo, nossos clientes) é sempre bom ter certeza verificando diretamente com a parte interessada. Indo ao Gemba. Tenha cuidado em presumir que você sabe com toda a certeza o que alguém deseja.

  > Is there a downside to OKRs? 
  
  ---
  > We needed John to remind us, “If everything’s at green, you failed.” That was counterintuitive for a lot of people
  
  ---
  > But John kept saying, “More red!” He was right. We needed more big ambitions because that’s what we’re good at. We’re less good at the incremental stuff
  
  O lado “negativo” dos OKRs é achar que porque todos os indicadores estão “verdes”, está tudo bem. John Doerr, autor do livro, diz que mais vermelhos é melhor, pois isso significa que há mais desafios a perseguir. É como na busca por excelência, que nunca termina: se você atingiu seus resultados de excelência, se desafie mais, suba a barra, para não se acostumar e achar que já melhorou tudo o que tinha que melhorar.

  > It takes intellectual rigor to effect change; it requires very serious strategies, indeed. If the heart doesn’t find a perfect rhyme with the head, then your passion means nothing.
  
  Excelente insight sobre gestão de mudanças — é necessário que todos os envolvidos sejam convencidos dos benefícios. Se o coração não sente o que a cabeça percebe, então não adianta transmitir paixão.

  > OKRs have such enormous potential because they are so adaptable. There is no dogma, no one right way to use them.

  > We grade them with a color scale to measure how well we did:
  > 0.0–0.3 is red
  > 0.4–0.6 is yellow
  > 0.7–1.0 is green

  > Poorly done/managed OKRs are a waste of time, an empty management gesture. Well done OKRs are a motivational management tool that helps make it clear to teams what’s important, what to optimize, and what tradeoffs to make during their day-to-day work.
  
  ---
  > Writing good OKRs isn’t easy, but it’s not impossible, either. Pay attention to the following simple rules:
  
  ---
  > Objectives are the “Whats.” They:
  > • express goals and intents;
  > • are aggressive yet realistic;
  > • must be tangible, objective, and unambiguous; should be obvious to a rational observer whether an objective has been achieved.
  > • The successful achievement of an objective must provide clear value for Google.
  
  ---
  > Key Results are the “Hows.” They:
  > • express measurable milestones which, if achieved, will advance objective(s) in a useful manner to their constituents;
  > • must describe outcomes, not activities. If your KRs include words like “consult,” “help,” “analyze,” or “participate,” they describe activities. Instead, describe the end-user impact of these activities: “publish average and tail latency measurements from six Colossus cells by March 7,” rather than “assess Colossus latency”;
  > • must include evidence of completion. This evidence must be available, credible, and easily discoverable. Examples of evidence include change lists, links to docs, notes, and published metrics reports.
  
  ---
  > Commitments are OKRs that we agree will be achieved, and we will be willing to adjust schedules and resources to ensure that they are delivered.
  
  Na escala de 0 a 1 para resultados de OKR estabelecida pelo Google, a expectativa é de que a nota final dos “commitments” seja 1.0, sendo que desvios devem ser justificados.
  
  ---
  > aspirational OKRs express how we’d like the world to look, even though we have no clear idea how to get there and/or the resources necessary to deliver the OKR.
  
  Na escala de 0 a 1 para resultados de OKR estabelecida pelo Google, a expectativa é de que a nota final dos “aspirational” seja 0.7 em média, sendo comum haver grandes diferenças, para mais ou menos.

  > TRAP #1: Failing to differentiate between committed and aspirational OKRs.

  > based on what the team believes it can achieve without changing anything they’re currently doing, as opposed to what the team or its customers really want.
  
  ---
  > TRAP #3: Timid aspirational OKRs.
  
  ---
  > start with, “What could my [or my customers’] world look like in several years if we were freed from most constraints?” By definition, you’re not going to know how to achieve this state when the OKR is first formulated—that is why it is an aspirational OKR. But without understanding and articulating the desired end state, you guarantee that you are not going to be able to achieve it.

  > TRAP #4: Sandbagging.
  
  ---
  > Teams who can meet all of their OKRs without needing all of their team’s headcount/capital . . . are assumed to either be hoarding resources or not pushing their teams, or both.
  
  ---
  > TRAP #5: Low Value Objectives (aka the “Who cares?” OKR). OKRs must promise clear business value—otherwise, there’s no reason to expend resources doing them. Low Value Objectives (LVOs) are those for which, even if the Objective is completed with a 1.0, no one will notice or care
  
  ---
  > Could the OKR get a 1.0 under reasonable circumstances without providing direct end-user or economic benefit? If so, then reword the OKR to focus on the tangible benefit.
  
  ---
  > TRAP #6: Insufficient KRs for committed Os.
  > • OKRs are divided into the desired outcome (the objective) and the measurable steps required to achieve that outcome (the key results). It is critical that KRs are written such that scoring 1.0 on all key results generates a 1.0 score for the objective.
  
  ---
  > Is it reasonably possible to score 1.0 on all the key results but still not achieve the intent of the objective? If so, add or rework the key results until their successful completion guarantees that the objective is also successfully completed.
  
  ---
  > Teams are expected to rearrange their other priorities to ensure an on-schedule 1.0 delivery.
  
  ---
  > Teams who cannot credibly promise to deliver a 1.0 on a committed OKR must escalate promptly. This is a key point
  
  ---
  > It allows the team’s management to develop options and resolve conflicts
  
  ---
  > every new OKR is likely to involve some amount of escalation, since it requires a change to existing priorities and commitments. An OKR that requires no changes to any group’s activities is a business-as-usual OKR, and those are unlikely to be new—although they may not have previously been written down
  
  ---
  > A committed OKR that fails to achieve a 1.0 by its due date requires a postmortem
  
  Eis um link entre OKRs e a prática de Hansei

  > The set of aspirational OKRs will by design exceed the team’s ability to execute in a given quarter.
  
  ---
  > In general, higher priority OKRs should be completed before lower priority OKRs.
  
  ---
  > Aspirational OKRs and their associated priorities should remain on a team’s OKR list until they are completed, carrying them forward from quarter to quarter as necessary. Dropping them from the OKR list because of lack of progress is a mistake, as it disguises persistent problems of prioritization, resource availability, or a lack of understanding of the problem/solution.
  
  Este comentário me remete a algo que eu considero extremamente válido: reportar o status de qualquer atividade (ou objetivo, no caso de OKRs), independente de termos conseguido progredir. Como ouvi o Almir dizendo uma vez: “temos que sempre deixar uma meta planejada, para nunca perdermos o norte”. Um dia as dificuldades de recursos, disponibilidade e priorização serão superadas e o objetivo estará ali esperando para ser alcançado.
